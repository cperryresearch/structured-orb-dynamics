# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on the guidelines of Keep a Changelog  
(https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),  
and this project adheres to semantic versioning.

## [v1.4.0] — 2025-12-17

### Added
- Part VI-A: *Exploratory Extension — Application of Structured Orb Dynamics to Biological Migration Systems*.
- Illustrative geometry-first state segmentation pipeline applied to GPS-tracked migratory passerine data (Movebank).
- Three-panel illustrative figure set (trajectory projection, curvature proxy, and state-segmented path) demonstrating cross-domain applicability under partial observation.

### Clarified
- Explicit separation between kinematic description and biological interpretation in cross-domain applications.
- Treatment of the *Orb* state as an uncertainty-dominated descriptive regime rather than a behavioral classification in known-class systems.

### Notes
- This extension is illustrative and methodological only; no new empirical claims, causal interpretations, or behavioral inferences are introduced.
- Core SOD definitions, state criteria, and UAP analyses remain unchanged.

## [v1.3.0] — 2025-12-16

### Added
- Appendix A: *Observable Robustness and Non-Causal Validation*, defining a protocol-ready set of non-causal robustness checks for curvature-based motion-state transitions.

### Clarified
- Formal distinction between semantic manuscript versioning and Zenodo archival versioning.
- Citation guidance updated to reference the Zenodo concept DOI, which always resolves to the latest archived version.

### Notes
- No results, datasets, figures, or conclusions were changed.
- This update formalizes quality-assurance procedures only.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-10
### Added
- Updated unified manuscript (PDF and LaTeX source) with refined text and clarified methodology.
- Additional explanations of curvature, derivative estimation, and motion-state segmentation.
- Revised PR-018 trajectory figure based on stabilized and compensated data.
- Expanded descriptions of methodology and analysis workflow in the manuscript.
- DOI badges for versioned release and concept record added to README.

### Changed
- Improved clarity and accessibility of the Abstract and Contributions sections.
- Edited terminology for consistency across the manuscript and repository.
- Updated README for professional documentation and inclusion of the research roadmap.

### Fixed
- Resolved minor inconsistencies in figure references within the manuscript.
- Corrected small typographical issues across Parts I–IV.

### Removed
- Transitional language from earlier drafts to maintain a consistent scientific tone.
